# 🔗 Link Billing to moleculeai-api Project

You enabled billing, but it needs to be **linked** to the `moleculeai-api` project!

## Quick Fix (2 clicks):

1. **Click this link:** https://console.cloud.google.com/billing?project=moleculeai-api

2. **If you see "Link a billing account":**
   - Click "Link a billing account"
   - Select your billing account (probably "My Billing Account 1")
   - Click "Set Account"

3. **OR if you see a dropdown at the top:**
   - Click the billing account dropdown
   - Select your billing account
   - It should link automatically

**After linking, tell me "billing linked" and I'll continue deploying!**

---

## Verify It's Linked:

You should see the project name change in the URL or at the top from "antiquant" to "moleculeai-api", or you'll see billing info for the moleculeai-api project.

---

**Once linked, I'll immediately deploy Cloud Run!** 🚀
