# ✅ Social Share Image - Fixed!

## 🎨 What Was Fixed:

1. **No More Overlap**: Logo icon and text are now clearly separated
   - Logo icon: Top section (y=180px)
   - Text section: Bottom section (y=400px)
   - Clear gap of ~220px between them

2. **Better Layout**:
   - Logo centered at top
   - "MoleculeAI" title below logo
   - Tagline below title
   - Feature icons at bottom

3. **Proper Colors**: 
   - Now using `rsvg-convert` which preserves RGB colors
   - Gradient background renders correctly
   - No more grayscale conversion

## 📐 Layout Structure:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│   [Blue-Purple Gradient]     │
│                             │
│      [Logo Icon]            │  ← Top (180px)
│   (molecular structure)      │
│                             │
│      [Gap - No Overlap]     │  ← ~220px gap
│                             │
│      MoleculeAI             │  ← Text (400px)
│  Quantum-Enhanced Drug...   │
│                             │
│  🧬 AI  ⚛ Quantum  💊 Drug  │  ← Features
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

## ✅ Result:

- **No overlap** between logo and text
- **Proper RGB colors** (not grayscale)
- **Professional design** with clear hierarchy
- **Ready for social sharing** (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.)
